class BaseDNSController(BaseController):
    """Base class to be inherited by every clouds that supports a DNS
    sub-controller.

    This base controller factors out all the basic steps common to all or
    most clouds into a base class, and defines an interface for provider or
    technology specific cloud controllers.

    Subclasses are meant to extend or override methods of this base class to
    account for differencies between different cloud types.

    Care should be taken when considering to add new methods to a subclass.
    All controllers should have the same interface, to the degree this is
    feasible. That is to say, don't add a new method to a subclass unless
    there is a very good reason to do so.

    The following convention is followed:

    Any methods and attributes that don't start with an underscore are the
    controller's public API.

    In the `BaseDNSController`, these public methods will in most cases contain
    a basic implementation that works for most clouds, along with the proper
    logging and error handling. In almost all cases, subclasses SHOULD NOT
    override or extend the public methods of `BaseController`. To account for
    cloud/subclass specific behaviour, one is expected to override the
    internal/private methods of `BaseDNSController`.

    Any methods and attributes that start with an underscore are the
    controller's internal/private API.

    To account for cloud/subclass specific behaviour, the public methods of
    `BaseDNSController` call a number of private methods. These methods will
    always start with an underscore, such as `_list_zones`.

    This `BaseDNSController` defines a strict interface to controlling clouds
    that allow for DNS specific actions.
    For each different cloud type, a subclass needs to be defined. Each
    subclass MUST receive its main controller as its sole init argument
